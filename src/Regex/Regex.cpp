 * Description:
 * This is the implementation of the class Regexp.
 *
 * TODO:
 * - Handle tokens as something else than chars
 *
 * - Instead of using the Shunting-Yard algorithm,
 * we should probably use a parser and determine if
 * the regular expression is syntactically valid and
 * convert to postfix during parsing
 *
